<h1>CSSE1 Retrospective</h1>
<h2>Five Pieces of Important Experience</h2>
<p>Throughout this class, I learned many valuable skills through my accomplishments that will drive my career in computer science. Here are five examples of accomplishments and things I learned</p> 
<ul>
    <li>I learned how to use GitHub and how to create and manage repositories, branches, forks, pull requests, and issues. I created many repositories to manage group and personal projects, both in and out of school.</li>
    <li>I installed and learned how to use helpful external tools such as Jupyter Notebooks, Ubuntu terminal, and WSL.</li>
    <li>I learned how to collaborate on projects and communicate effectively, such as when I created and taught a coding lesson in the beginning of the class with a group of people and when Evan and I created and presented our RPG game.</li>
    <li>I learned how to optimize and organize my Javascript code using objects with methods and ternary operators.</li>
    <li>I learned a lot about Markdown when creating my blog.</li>
</ul>
<h2>RPG game tinkers</h2>
We tried a few new things out when making our RPG game. Here are some of the things we tried:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improving movement</strong> - One of the first things we did was experiment with the movement system. We eventually settled on a fast, linear movement system that is more predictable and easier to control than the previous one.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom HTML elements from Javascript</strong> - Our most ambitious "tinker" was adding in a custom-made password creation minigame. To do it, I created a new Javascript file and used it to code in an HTML element with a box that showed inputs. I also used objects and arrays to make requirements that the player had to meet in order to pass.</li>
    <li><strong>Randomized dialogue</strong> - Another tinker that adds some life to the game was randomized dialogue. To do it, we made the characters' responses arrays in which the first element was "$list$" and then added an "if" statement in around the alert function to check for that item in the beginning. If the response contained that item, the code would pick a random item from the list to display. This dialogue system helps make the game more immersive, with the characters' speech sounding less robotic.</li>
    <li><strong>Using a currency</strong> - We also decided to make the main goal of the game a money-related one. In order to escape the basement, players must earn at least $250. We added multiple ways for players to earn money, but they must sake some route to get enough.</li>
    <li><strong>Using a custom font</strong> - And no, I'm not just talking about the built in font families. For the password game, I used a font called "Sixtyfour" that I had to get from Google Fonts. I embedded it into the top of our game's HTML page, which is how I got it to show up.</li>
    <li><strong>Using audio</strong> - We added a generic celebration sound that plays when someone finishes the level.</li>
</ul>
Here is the game:

<h2>N@TM Feedback</h2>
<p>When we presented our game, we opened up a Google form for people to give us feedback. The responses varied, but most of the responses included the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Polishing the game</strong> - Some people said that the game needed some big fixes and UI cleanup.</li>
    <li><strong>Adding more features</strong> - Others said that the game needed more features, such as minigames.</li>
    <li><strong>Instructions</strong> - A few people also said that the game needed some instructions, mainly on how to control the player and how to make money.</li>
</ul>
Here is a screenshot showing some of the responses:

<h2>Other Projects I Enjoyed</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bathroom Pass</strong> - This was my favorite other project. I really like the idea of having out-of-class time on record so that there is no ambiguity as to how long a student was gone for. The bathroom pass does need a bit of polishing, especially in readability and accessability.</li>
    <li><strong>Aesthetihawk</strong> - I also thought this one was cool. I liked the UI improvements.</li>
</ul>
